## Countrystats

Building an understanding of gaps left to be mapped means understanding what and how local OSM communities have been able to map. Working with some partners we created a simple tableau visualization that shows the growth of OSM overtime. Visualizing the growth of an OSM community allows us to understand where the local community is in its growth and helps us determine what methods we might use to help build up the mapping community. Together with some other tools such as the Missing Maps leaderboards and [OSM Analytics](http://osm-analytics.org) we are building a great understanding of where the maps are missing.
