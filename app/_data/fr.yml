  objectives:
    title:      "Objectives"
    text1:      "To map the most vulnerable places in the developing world, in order that international and local NGOs and individuals can use the maps and data to better respond to crises affecting the areas."
    text2:      "To support OpenStreetMap, specifically the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), in developing technologies, skills, workflows, and communities."
  ethics:
    title:      "Ethics"
    text1:      "Using OpenStreetMap ensures that all data gathered under the project banner will be free, open, and available for use under OpenStreetMap’s open license."
    text2:      "All 'in country' activities, i.e. local mapping and data collection, will be carried out in collaboration with local people and in a respectful manner at all times."
    text3:      "When working locally, people come before the data. Meaning if the goal is to map a city there needs to be a plan in place to ensure access to technology and training for those living in that community to continue using the maps after project completion."
    text4:      "Members of Missing Maps actively contribute to Missing Map's objectives, the OpenStreetMap repository and benefitting communities, both local and international."
    text5:      "Missing Maps activities emphasize building, and leaving behind, local capacity and access. We are cautious about rapid data collection without significant local participation, and always make efforts to ensure local access."
    text6:      "Missing Maps activities are designed to be accessible and open for participation for individuals who want to contribute towards the project objectives."
